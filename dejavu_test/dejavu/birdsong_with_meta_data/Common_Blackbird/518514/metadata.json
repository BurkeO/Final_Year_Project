    "rmk": "This clip is from a young male Blackbird, recorded on 19 September. The recording features what is loosely called 'sub-song'. I find that term ambiguous and unhelpful. The only vaguely apt part of the term is 'sub', implying that the 'song' is, in some way, inferior. Well, it may be inferior but it isn't really true song at all. Young Blackbirds and many other young songbirds need to develop singing skills and start the process during autumn and then winter. They are, therefore, practicing \u2013 and not singing properly. If they were singing properly, they would be doing so for one of two reasons: to proclaim ownership of territory or attract a mate. Not only are youngsters not bothering about either of these objectives, but their vocal performance, by its very nature, proves that they have a different purpose. In effect, they are practicing and singing to themselves. Rather than terming the sound 'sub-song', a better description might be 'self-song'. Three qualities show that the utterance is not meant for an audience. First, the vocals are very quiet and not audible except very close - within, say, five metres. This clip was recorded from a hidden microphone about 2m from the bird. Second, the vocalist is concealed, typically perched within a bush, hedge or thicket. Third, the composition sounds nothing like typical song and, in Blackbird, rambles on and on and contains interwoven notes that are part of the bird's full vocabulary. In this clip, although the voice is low and the components are not easy to distinguish, you can hear examples (rehearsals?) of the following: an alarm rattle at 0:01; juvenile screech-call at the end of 0:02 [a full recording from a juvenile is at XC180419]; two typical melodic song notes at 0:09; two nervous 'chook' calls at 0:20; a further alarm rattle \u2013 epitomising a flight alarm \u2013 at 0:21, repetition of song notes at 0:24 (a singing Blackbird quite often includes a few repetitions). The bird was well concealed in dense shrubbery throughout the recording. In total, it was 'singing' on and off for about twenty minutes. In the end it flew off silently. Hence, the flight alarms in the clip were actually given at rest. A gusty wind meant that large parts of the recording were inaudible. It is interesting that the weather - bad for birdsong - was no impediment. This is further support for the bird's vocalizing serving as a kind of private practice session.",
