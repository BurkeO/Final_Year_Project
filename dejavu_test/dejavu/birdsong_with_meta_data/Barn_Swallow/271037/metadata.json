    "rmk": "The recordings begins with three calls from a passing Chough. The Chough was cruising overhead along the line of a small road. I was out of sight and screened by a barn. I think that the Chough called because it spotted me. In turn, the Swallow (an adult) joined in the commotion. Swallow alarm calls begin at 0:07. Two young Swallows were perched farther away so I assume that the adult was training them to associate the alarm call with humans. Perhaps the Swallow's nest was inside the barn (I did not look inside)  and I was too close for comfort.",
