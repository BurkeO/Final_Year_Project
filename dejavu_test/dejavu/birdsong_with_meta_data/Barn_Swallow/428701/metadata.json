    "rmk": "The clip is edited from several minutes of sounds made by two young Swallows that were sitting on a cottage roof. At least one parent was 'keeping an eye' on them and (probably) occasionally arriving to feed them.  I did not see any of the activity as I left the recorder and then played back the result. The opening ten seconds contain a burst of calls that accompanied the youngsters flying off [0:02]. This was when I left the recorder on the cottage roof, thereby disturbing them. At some point, a Wren landed on the roof and it must have perched right beside the recorder because its song is loud and clear at 0:10. After that, the Wren changes perch and the subsequent song-bursts are not so close. From 0:30, the young Swallows are resting on the roof and making typical twitters - the sound of offspring hoping to receive food from an incoming parent. It seems that, at around forty seconds, an adult flies in and may have delivered food - the calls become more intense at 0:45. Irrespective of whether the young were fed or not, they fly off at the end of the recording.",
