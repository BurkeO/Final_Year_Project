    "rmk": "A short clip from several minutes of calling by a migrant Arctic Warbler. A Blackbird can be discerned calling occasionally  in the background and flies away, making alarm calls, after 0:33. Fragments of Robin song can be heard, such as at 0:13. The Arctic Warbler was found in the early morning and may well have been freshly arrived. Next day it was much more quiet and scarcely called, despite being watched for long periods (or rather, the habitat that concealed it was watched). The call is sharp and sudden and beats like a somewhat erratic pulse: sometimes repeated at the same interval, sometimes not; sometimes louder and piqued, sometimes sotto voce, although always piercing. A recording during rain is at XC279153.",
