    "rmk": "Three other recordings of the same Arctic Warbler are at XC279149, XC279150 and XC279152. This recording is different because of the heavy rain falling in the background. The rain had just started. In fact, it lasted for an amazing 24 hours and caused considerable flooding in nearby areas of the Irish mainland. The Arctic Warbler was in a sycamore tree whose remaining foliage was barely able to provide shelter, although the bird was feeding well on insects among withered leaves and twigs. Shortly after it flew off, presumably to find better shelter. Next day it was much more quiet and scarcely called, despite being watched for long periods (or rather, the habitat that concealed it was watched). The call is sharp and sudden and beats like a somewhat erratic pulse: sometimes repeated at the same interval, sometimes not; sometimes louder and piqued, sometimes sotto voce, although always piercing.",
