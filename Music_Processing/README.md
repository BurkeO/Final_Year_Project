# FMP notebooks

* Documentation can be found in orga/docu
* Important note:
  Before using gitlab for the FMP notebooks, make sure to install 
  the [nbstripout pre-commit hook](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout)
  Otherwise version control with Jupyter notebooks becomes very problematic!
  
    source activate FMP
    nbstripout --install
